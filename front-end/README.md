# Front-End

Front-end part of the app.

## Quick start

1. Run `yarn` or `npm install`
2. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Tech stack

- React
- Jest
- SCSS
- Bootstrap (for some quick design)

## Architecture

Atomic composition with Smart/Dumb components.

Smart components handle requests and global state management, they are not meant to be re-used.
Dumb components only serve the data, they are meant to be re-used.

## Testing

`yarn test`, press "a" to run all test
